# Generate-secure-password
This python program uses the **string** module to get a string of all the upper and lower case letters, digits, and punctuation characters then uses the **random**, sample function to choose <i>"length"</i> random elements from this string and joins them together to form the password <br>
<p>You can customize the length of the password by passing in a different value for the length parameter when calling the generate password" function. <br> For example, to generate a 16 character password, you can call "generate password(16)"
</p>
I hope it's help you to secure your account with a strong password
